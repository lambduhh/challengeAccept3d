# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test.
# The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers
# differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the
# others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that
# among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a
# position of this number.
#
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
# which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
#
# ##Examples :
#
# iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 //
# Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
#
# iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 //
# Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
